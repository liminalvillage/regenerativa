    <description><![CDATA[This is an ongoing mapping of documentaries about regenerative projects. For the FAQ, expand this window:<br><br>---<br><br>How can I share this map with a simpler URL?<br><br>Easy - just use https://regen.earth<br><br>---<br><br>How can I submit a video/project?<br><br>Send suggestions via https://spherical.studio/contact/<br><br>---<br><br>Why are you doing this? <br><br>We wanted to know the stories of the field of practitioners bringing their world(s) to life. It's a labor of love, mostly to express gratitude to this remarkable community.<br><br>---<br><br>How do you pick the placenames?<br><br>We've done our best to categorize these projects by location, but many of these territories have multiple names. Many of the projects are located on unceded and/or Indigenous lands. For more about traditional placenames and details about Indigenous lands, see https://native-land.ca<br><br>---<br><br>Has the map been used elsewhere?<br><br>We're delighted to report that many of these projects have now been enshrined in the science fiction canon by Kim Stanley Robinson, who gave voice to this map in his latest book Ministry for the Future: <br><br>https://tinyurl.com/regenministry<br><br>---<br><br>What are the criteria for selection?<br><br>We curate the map for projects that:<br><br>a) are inspiring in their ambition and scope <br>and <br>b) have had a short or long-form documentary made about them. <br><br>Of course there are many remarkable regenerative projects in the world, so this is simply an effort to illuminate the expanding field.<br><br>Unfortunately, due to the technical limitations of Google My Maps, the videos must be on YouTube (not Vimeo or other platforms).<br><br>---<br><br>Why are you doing this?<br><br>We want to showcase tangible examples of the how diverse communities are collaborating to benefit the regeneration of Earth's living systems.<br><br>---<br><br>How can I view the videos for each project?<br><br>In a laptop or desktop browser, click a project pin then click the image that appears in the column on the left. This will display a YouTube video over the map. If the project has multiple videos, an arrow will appear to the right of the first video. Click on it to view additional videos and photos.<br><br>In a tablet browser, click a project pin then click the image that appears at the bottom of the screen. <br><br>Unfortunately, the video functionality is unpredictable on mobile phones. This is a technical limitation of Google's My Maps.<br><br>---<br><br>Who created/curates/maintains this?<br><br>We are Spherical (http://spherical.studio). Our studio explores the potential of maps, stories, and metaphors to help transform relationships to the world and each other.<br><br>---<br><br>How long have you been doing this?<br><br>We started this map in December of 2016.<br><br>---<br><br>Where can I learn more?<br><br>Click on the links in the project descriptions or visit John Thackara's People Doing Stuff collections of case studies: <br><br>http://thackara.com/notopic/people-doing-stuff-case-study-collections/<br><br>---<br><br>Thank you for all of your suggestions thus far.
